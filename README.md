This project will be an opportunity to learn more and understand different types of lists in JavaScript. This is a tutorial project.
The type of lists that will be created will be an Array, Link Lists, Doubly Link Lists, Stacks and more.
Use this website for better understanding of JavaScript: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript

You can use other programming applications with these files but personally, I recommend visual studio 2019 and/or https://nodejs.org/en/ (This website).
